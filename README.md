# 📈 Simple Profit/Loss Calculator 📉

**Simple Profit/Loss Calculator** is a user-friendly and efficient tool designed for beginner traders and investors to calculate profits or losses for their trades. Whether you’re managing risk or planning a new trade, this tool helps you stay in control of your financial strategies with just a few clicks.

This is my first project, and it came about a year ago when I started trading and needed a visual, easy-to-understand tool to calculate potential profits and losses. Before this, I was doing the calculations manually, and although there were some web alternatives, I needed a desktop solution that was simple.

For this project, I used **CustomTkinter** to improve the interface that I had previously developed in my personal version of this program.
